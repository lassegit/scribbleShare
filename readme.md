# Scribble Share

## Goal

Explore the possibilities for creating a React Native feature where the user draws a scribble and shares an animation of the drawing (i.e. recording the process).

## Option 1: The way of the GIF

To create a GIF an array of images is needed. To create an GIF of a drawing simply store an image after finished "stroke". When done, simply create a GIF of the images (server side). I decided to test this quickly, `server/` and `src/` contains the code for it. View installation below or GIF screencast to see how it functions:

Creating a GIF drawing:

<img src="assets/drawingToGif.gif" width="300" />

Created GIF:

<img src="assets/animated.gif" width="300" />

### Pro

- easy sharable across platforms

### Con

- feels a bit clunky

## Option 2: The way of the animated canvas (under investigation)

The drawing canvas ([react-native-sketch-canvas](https://nicedoc.io/terrylinla/react-native-sketch-canvas)) generates an array of paths (and other data) making up the entire drawing. Data can be saved and drawing can be recreated (though without any fancy animation, at least out of the box). It is however unclear, how this data can be utilized outside of the drawing library; embedded in a SVG or on a canvas with a smooth drawing animation. The format generated by [Bodymovin](https://codingwithmitch.com/blog/understanding-the-internals-of-lottie-rendering-the-animation-file/#bodymovin-json-attributes) is different from the data object generated from the sketch canvas.

### Todo

- investigate how we can use the data genered with `react-native-sketch-canvas` outside of the drawing editor (potentially with Lottie or another animation library)

### Pro

- user can open older drawings and edit them
- potentially smooth drawing animations on canvas element

### Con

- difficult to share across platforms

## Installation

- Install Imagemagick library: `brew install imagemagick`
- `yarn install`

Run the server: `yarn server` and start the IOS simulator `yarn ios`.

## End notes

- Lottie renders animations created in Adobe After Effects via the Bodymovin plugin.
